Database Systems - IISc Course Project
We aim to reduce the Error-Prone Selectivity Space for the Plan Bouquet algorithm recently proposed by the DSL lab ( http://dsl.serc.iisc.ernet.in/projects/QUEST/index.html#pub )
Further Details of this project are here in my blog ( http://adarshpatil.in/timewarp/projects/error-prone-predicates.html )
